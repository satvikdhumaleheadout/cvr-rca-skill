-- Q3: Daily funnel rates — pre and post period
-- Used by Claude to spot sudden drops vs gradual drift,

-- Pre-filtered to {{PRIMARY_MBHO}} to match the primary segment analysis.

-- Placeholders: {{CE_ID}}, {{PRE_START}}, {{PRE_END}},
--               {{POST_START}}, {{POST_END}}, {{PRIMARY_MBHO}}
